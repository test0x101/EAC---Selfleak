# Fortnite EAC SelfLeak 
This source has been public for a couple weeks now, let me go into full detail how this source/what it does.

# Features
- SME Bypassing
- Supports Port Binding (Optional more of a custom redirect function "still testing")
- Bypasses EAC/EOS's packet system and has a semi operational method to cypher different packets.
- Injector is FUD and injects through a custom export instead of classic DLLMain
- Injector supports custom imports this source has spoofcalling imports supported "test functionalitly"
- Allocates in a legit region so dont worry about getting tapped for injection.

# Cheat it self
- Uses UE5 to render (UCanvas)
- Instead of hooking PostRender/DrawTransition to get canvas we are creating our own using Kismet rendering tools (found inside of UE5 SDK)
- Cool features like Bullet TP, and Fake Lag.

# Where injector?
- Posting injector along side full source at 50 stars. :)
